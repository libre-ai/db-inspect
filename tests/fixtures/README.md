# DB Inspect Fixtures

These fixtures are executable contracts for `db-inspect`.

Each case should contain:

- `schema.sql` — sanitized PostgreSQL schema or SQL excerpt;
- `manifest.json` — `{ data, meta }` DB security manifest;
- optional `migrations/` — ordered SQL migrations;
- optional `expected-report.json` — minimal expected report shape.

Fixtures must not contain real secrets, DSNs, row data, raw embeddings, prompts, source text, or personal data.

| `fail/default_privileges_grant_all_dangerous` | Over-broad `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES ... GRANT ALL` for future objects. |
| `fail/tenant_derivation_wrong_setting` | Derived tenant policy uses the wrong session setting; blocks in `release`. |
| `fail/tenant_derivation_path_invalid` | Derived tenant path syntax is malformed/unsupported; blocks in `release`. |
| `fail/tenant_derivation_multihop_policy_missing` | Multi-hop derived tenant path with FK chain but missing policy proof; blocks in `release`. |
| `redaction/secret_like_sql_comments` | Regression fixture ensuring fake DSN/token/comment content does not leak into JSON/Markdown reports. |
